% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to build an audio amplifier, developing a circuit containing 2 stages, the voltage stage and the output stage.
The maximum Audio In is 10 mV, the supply voltage $V_{cc}$ is 12 V and the Audio Out is an 8 $\Omega$ speaker.
The circuit created and analysed in this assignment can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:Circuit}.\\
In order to evaluate how successfully our goal has been achieved, we calculate the merit M of our work, using the following expression:
\begin{equation}
M = \frac{gain*bandwidth}{cost*lowerCutoffFrequency}
  \label{eq:merit}
\end{equation}
where the cost is given by cost = cost of resistors + cost of capacitors + cost of transistors, knowing that each kOhm costs 1 monetary unit (MU), 
each $\mu$F costs 1 MU and each transistor costs 0,1 MU.
\noindent In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, using Octave. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by
simulation using ngspice. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. In addiction, the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.
