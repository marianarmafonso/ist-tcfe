\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Comparing the theoretical analysis and the simulation, it can be concluded that both the values obtained in the nodal 
and mesh methods are similar to those obtained in the simulation. \\
\noindent Regarding the nodal analysis, the data obtained was the same as the one in the simulation. 
Such might happen because this is a systematic method preferred for circuit simulation programs such as ngspice.
As for the mesh method, the values are also very similar to the ones generated in the simulation. \\
This similarity between theoretical analysis and simulation by ngspice can also be related to the low complexity of the considered circuit
and to the fact that it only contains linear components.
\noindent Taking all of this into account, the theoretical analysis showed coherent values relative to the simulation, 
proving Node and Mesh Methods to be reliable for the analysis of this circuit.
